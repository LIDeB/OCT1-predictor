ðŸ“ŒAbout Us

We are a drug discovery team with an interest in the development of publicly available open-source customizable cheminformatics tools
to be used in computer-assisted drug discovery. We belong to the Laboratory of Bioactive Research and Development (LIDeB) of the
National University of La Plata (UNLP), Argentina. Our research group is focused on computer-guided drug repurposing and rational discovery
of new drug candidates to treat epilepsy and neglected tropical diseases.

**OCT1 Substrate Prediction**

**It is a free web-application for Organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) Substrate Prediction**

Organic Cation Transporters (OCTs) are members of the Solute Carrier (SLC) group of transporters and belong to the Major Facilitator superfamily.
According to the Human Genome Organization, they are assigned to the SLC22A family, which includes electrogenic and electroneutral organic cation transporters and Organic Anion Transporters (OATs),
a large group of carriers involved in the uptake of organic anions. 
OCTs are multispecific, bidirectional carriers that transport organic cations and are critically involved in the absorption, disposition, and excretion of many exogenous compounds.
In humans, organic cation transporters from the SLC22A family include OCT1 (SLC22A1), OCT2 (SLC22A2), OCT3 (SLC22A3), OCT1 is mainly found in the liver (basolateral membrane of hepatocytes).
Low expression levels of OCT1 have also been detected in other tissues, including the intestine, kidneys, lungs, and brain..

Why is it important to predict whether a molecule is an OCT1 substrate? 
Numerous clinically relevant drugs (e.g. metformin, morphine, fenoterol, sumatriptan, tramadol and tropisetron) have been shown to be substrates of OCT1, 
and OCT1 deficiency has been shown to affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or toxicity of these drugs.

The OCT1 Substrate predictor is a Web App that ensembles 14 linear models to classify molecules as OCT1 substrates or OCT1 non-substrates.
